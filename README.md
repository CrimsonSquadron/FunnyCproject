# FunnyCproject
Just made it for the funnies. No real goal here. Mainly used to practice C, C++, and C#. Everything will be updated upstream with Azure DevOps and then downstream to GitHub.

# To Compile
Download Visual Studio 2022. In the installer portion select Windows 11 or 10 SDK (MAKE SURE TO GRAB THE LATEST!). After just open the C++ file in a new project and hit Ctrl+B.
Follow the path to the complete .exe. Or instead just download the .exe from the releases tab. Makes my life easier and your life easier. 

# How do I exit the program 
You don't. Just kidding after the program runs just type exit into the prompt. The program will close.

# This is a program NOT an app
Apps are Applications they run on phones, etc. Programs are meant to run on a single device only. 

# Support for other OSes will be available later on.
